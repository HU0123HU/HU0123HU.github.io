  <p>
    This project explores how robot-mediated communication can enhance the presence of remote participants in hybrid group discussions.
    We designed two types of telepresence robots: <em>Buzzo</em>, a minimal motion-based presence bot, and <em>Eureka</em>, a socially expressive robot capable of emotional gestures.
    Through two field studies involving classroom and conference settings, the research examines how physical embodiment, social signaling, and spatial positioning influence the integration, perceived presence, and participation equity of remote users.
    The results suggest that expressive robots like <em>Eureka</em> significantly enhance engagement, making remote participants feel more “present” in hybrid interactions.
