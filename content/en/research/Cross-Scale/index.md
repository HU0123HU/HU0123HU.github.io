  <p>
    This project, developed as my Master’s thesis, explores a cross-scale gamified learning system 
    that helps middle school students grasp abstract circuit concepts through tangible and embodied interaction. 
    The system integrates two modules: a macro-level tabletop interface for real-world circuit construction guided by projection animations, 
    and a micro-level first-person game where students use body movements to simulate the behavior of electrons in LC resonant circuits. 
    By combining physical manipulation with immersive gameplay and symbolic feedback, the study demonstrates how learners can better connect operational, 
    experiential, and theoretical knowledge. Results from classroom-based experiments show significant improvements in students’ conceptual understanding, 
    engagement, and cognitive integration across scales.
