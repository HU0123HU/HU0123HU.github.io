  <div class="section-title">🧩 Overview</div>
  <p>
    Thermaterial is a novel composite material system that enables the programmable control of ambient heat transfer through embedded fluidic structures. 
    By integrating fluid channels filled with different thermal agents into everyday objects, users can dynamically manipulate heat retention and dissipation properties. 
    This research introduces a fabrication method and simulation tool that allow designers to shape thermal experiences in space and on surfaces—potentially transforming how we design comfort, interaction, and responsiveness in physical environments. 
    Applications include personalized thermal zones, responsive furniture, and energy-efficient designs.
