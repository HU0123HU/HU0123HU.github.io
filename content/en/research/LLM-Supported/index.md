  <p>
    This research explores how Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, can support middle school students’ creativity during project-based learning (PBL).
    Through an observational study and a week-long instructional experiment with 31 students, the study identified five design considerations and proposed a novel LLM-empowered PBL program.
    Results show that LLMs can support all phases of PBL—from idea discovery to final presentation—by boosting creative self-efficacy and providing personalized, real-time feedback.
    The study also discusses students’ ambivalent perceptions of LLMs and highlights design implications for integrating AI tools into educational settings.
