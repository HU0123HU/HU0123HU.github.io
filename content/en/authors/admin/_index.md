I am a researcher and designer exploring how **Mixed Reality (XR)**, **Urban Digital Twins**, and **Gamified Systems** can bridge the gap between complex data and human experience. Currently a Master's student in Industrial Design at Tsinghua University, my work focuses on **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** for social good, aiming to translate abstract systems into accessible, embodied interactions.

My research background is grounded in bridging the cognitive gap. I have developed award-winning educational systems, such as a cross-scale MR learning interface for circuit education , and published in leading venues including **CHI, HRI, HCII, and IASDR**. My design practice has been recognized by the **2025 iF Design Award** and the **2020 National Scholarship (Top 1%)**.

Beyond academia, I bring substantial industrial experience in **Digital Twins for Urban Lifelines**. During my time as a Digital Twin Engineer, I orchestrated the digitalization of municipal infrastructure to enhance urban resilience. This dual background informs my current Ph.D. research interest: **shifting Urban Digital Twins from expert-centric tools to "Social Mediators"**. I am dedicated to developing Situated Narrative Frameworks that empower public sensemaking and participatory governance in the face of climate challenges.

I am seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in **2026**, focusing on **Urban Computing, Social Computing, and Immersive Analytics** within the context of **Smart Cities and Climate Resilience**.
