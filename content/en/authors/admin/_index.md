I am a master's student in **Industrial Design** at **Tsinghua University**, advised by **Prof. Luqi Chen**. I also previously served as a Research Intern at **The Future Laboratory, Tsinghua University**. 

My research focuses on **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Embodied Interaction**, specifically exploring **Mixed Reality (MR)**, **exergames**, and **serious games**. I investigate how immersive technologies and movement-based interactions can be leveraged to support physical training and education. By blending hardware prototyping with empirical research, my work translates abstract systems into accessible, human-centered experiences.

I have published in leading venues such as **IJHCS**, **CHI EA**, **HRI**, **HCII**, and **IASDR** (Top-tier Design Conference). My interdisciplinary work has also been recognized with multiple honors, including the **2025 Beijing Outstanding Graduate (Top 5%)**, the **2025 iF DESIGN AWARD**, and the **2020 National Scholarship (Top 1%)**.

I am currently seeking **Ph.D. opportunities starting in Fall 2026**, aiming to advance the research of immersive and movement-based technologies to create engaging and human-centered experiences.
